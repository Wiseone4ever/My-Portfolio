# Database Design and Implementation

##  E-R Diagram Design
![Github Action Workflow]("../erd.png")

##  Relationship Sets
![Github Action Workflow]("../relationship_sets.png")

### Cardinalities:

*	A customer can have multiple orders (**1:N** relationship between **CUSTOMERS** and **ORDERS**).

*	We assume that a customer can order only one type of product.

*	A product belongs to only one category, but a category can have multiple products (**1:N** relationship between **PRODUCT_CATERGORY** and **PRODUCTS**).

*	A supplier can supply many products (**1:N** relationship between **SUPPLIERS** and **PRODUCTS**).

*	An order results in one shipment but one shipment can contain multiple orders(**1:M** relationship between **ORDERS** and **SHIPMENTS**).

*	A gift card can be associated with only one order (**1:1** relationship between **GIFT_CARDS** and **ORDERS**).

### Assumptions:

*	Every Order must have a Customer, but a Customer does not necessarily need to have an Order.

*	If a customer buys several things on the same day, and if all those things are coming from the same place, they'll be packed together and sent off with one tracking number.

*	Our e-commerce business operates directly with suppliers, and we do not have any storage facilities for inventory.

*	Every customer, product category, supplier, product, gift card, order, and shipment is uniquely identified by their respective ID fields (**customer_id, category_id, supplier_id, product_id, gift_card_id, order_id, shipment_id**).

*	Orders reference **CUSTOMERS, PRODUCTS, SHIPMENT,** and **GIFT_CARD** through their respective ID fields, establishing a connection to existing records in those tables.

*	Products reference **PRODUCT_CATEGORY** and **SUPPLIERS** through **category_id** and **supplier_id**, ensuring that each product is linked to existing categories and suppliers.

* **Mandatory Information**:
    + Customers must have a **customer_id, first_name, and date_of_birth**.
    + Products must have a **product_id, stock_quantity, category_id, and supplier_id**.
    + Orders must have an **order_id and order_status**.
    + Shipments must have a **shipment_id and status**.
        
*	**Nullable Fields**: Some fields are optional, such as last_name for customers, which suggests that not all information is required to create a record in the database.

*	**Data Type Restrictions**: Email and phone fields for customers and supplier_email for suppliers are unique, implying that no two records can have the same value for these fields.

*	**premium_subscription** in **CUSTOMERS** is an integer, which is indicated using a  **boolean** value (0 or 1) 

*	The price in **PRODUCTS** is of type **REAL**, allowing for decimal values.

*	**Gift Cards**: Gift cards are considered an entity but might not be required for an order, as the gift_card_id in the ORDERS table can be null.

*	**Shipment Process**: The **SHIPMENT** table's **dispatch_timestamp** and **delivered_timestamp** suggest tracking the timeline of a shipment but they're not set as NOT NULL, so there might be cases where a shipment is created in the system before an actual dispatch time is known.

*	**Payment and Order Timing**: Orders have both an **order_timestamp** and a **payment_timestamp**, which may not always be the same—this allows tracking the time the order was made and when the payment was processed.

*	**Stock Management**: stock_quantity in PRODUCTS suggests the system tracks inventory levels, but there is no direct link to orders for decrementing stock, which implies this might be managed by a separate process or system.

*	**Data Consistency**: The use of foreign keys enforces data consistency, ensuring that records in linked tables must exist before they can be referenced in an association.



##  SQL Database Schema Creation 

This code is like organizing a digital warehouse for an e-commerce business. It sets up different sections in a database for storing information about customers, product categories, suppliers, products, gift cards, orders, and shipments. Each section is designed to keep specific types of information, ensuring that everything from customer details to order and shipment records is neatly organized and interconnected. The code ensures that each item, whether a customer or a product, is unique and correctly linked to related information, like linking a product to its supplier. It's like setting up shelves and labeling them in a warehouse to ensure everything is easy to find and in the right place.

#  Data Generation and Management 

##  Synthetic Data Generation

This code simulates part of an e-commerce operation by creating a set of mock orders based on existing data for customers, products, suppliers, and gift cards. It goes through these steps:

1. Finding Data: It locates and organizes data files for different categories like customers and products.
2. Loading Data: The first file from each category is loaded to form datasets for analysis.
3. Sampling: A subset of products and customers is randomly selected to make the data more manageable.
4. Order Creation: It generates fake orders, pairing products with customers and applying gift cards as needed, while recording details like payment method and order status.
5. Linking Suppliers: Each order is linked to the corresponding supplier based on the product information.
6. Shipment Grouping: Unique shipment IDs are created for orders, grouping them logically for shipping.
7. Data Cleaning: The orders are refined for realism, like removing shipment details from canceled orders.
8. Gift Card Update: The status of gift cards used in the orders is updated to 'USED'.

Essentially, this script creates a realistic snapshot of transactions for analysis, reflecting various aspects of e-commerce activities.

This code transforms order data into shipment information by doing the following:

1. It sets a dispatch date for each order to either the day the order was made or the next day.
2. It then assigns a delivery date to each order, ensuring it's 2 to 14 days after the dispatch date.
3. Orders are given a status based on their current phase, like "Ready for Dispatch" if they're being processed, or "In Transit" if they've been shipped.
4. The code cleans up the data by keeping only shipment-related details, removing duplicates and any incomplete records.
5. Lastly, it updates the dispatch and delivery dates based on the shipment status, for example, clearing the delivery date for orders "In Transit."

The updated shipment details are saved, providing a clear snapshot of when orders are dispatched, expected delivery times, and their current status.

```{r}

##  Data Import and Quality Assurance

This code is like a checklist for a data table, ensuring all the needed items (columns) are there. If anything's missing, it alerts you; otherwise, it confirms everything is in order.

```{r}
check_column_match <- function(df, expected_cols) {
  # Check if all expected columns are present in the dataframe
  missing_cols <- setdiff(expected_cols, names(df))

  if (length(missing_cols) > 0) {
    stop(sprintf("The dataframe is missing these columns expected by the SQL table: %s", 
                 paste(missing_cols, collapse = ", ")))
  }
  
  return(TRUE)
}
```

This code is like a checklist for a data table, ensuring all the needed items (columns) are there. If anything's missing, it alerts you; otherwise, it confirms everything is in order.

## Task 2.2: Data Import and Quality Assurance

CUSTOMERS

This code is like a gatekeeper for customer data entering a digital database:

1. Connection: It links up with the database to start processing customer information.
2. Checklist: It verifies that each piece of incoming data has all the required fields, like name, contact info, and other personal details.
3. Validation: It ensures emails and genders are in the right format and that essential data isn't missing.
4. Updating: It adds new customer details to the database, avoiding duplicates and ensuring data is accurately recorded.
5. Wrap-Up: After processing, it closes the connection to the database to secure the data.

This is done for each batch of customer data, keeping the database current and correct.

PRODUCT_CATEGORY 

This code is about adding new product categories to an e-commerce database. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. Connecting to Database: It starts by connecting to the e-commerce database to prepare for adding new information.
2. Checking the List: The code expects each product category data to have two specific pieces of information: a unique category ID and the category name. It checks to make sure this data is present before proceeding.
3. Ensuring Completeness: It makes sure that none of the required details (category ID and name) are missing for any of the categories.
4. Adding Categories: For each category, it first checks if the category ID already exists in the database to avoid duplicates. If the category is new, it adds the category ID and name into the database.
5. Handling Issues: If there's a problem adding a category (like a technical glitch), it will let you know without stopping the whole process.
6. Wrapping Up: Once all the categories from the file have been checked and added, it closes the connection to the database.

This process repeats for each file in a list of category files, ensuring all new product categories are added to the database efficiently and correctly.

```{r, results='hide'}
ingest_product_category <- function(df) {
  
  my_connection <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite()

SUPPLIERS

This code is about adding new supplier information to an e-commerce database. It works like this:

1. Connecting: First, it sets up a connection with the database where supplier information needs to be stored.
2. Checking Requirements: The code expects each supplier's information to include an ID, name, address, phone number, and email. It makes sure these details are present and correctly formatted, especially the email.
3. Ensuring Quality: The code also checks for incomplete records, particularly making sure that each supplier has both an ID and a name.
4. Adding Suppliers: One by one, it attempts to add suppliers to the database. Before adding, it checks to ensure the supplier isn't already in the database to avoid duplicates.
5. Dealing with Problems: If there's an issue while adding a supplier, like a mistake in the data or a technical glitch, the code notes the problem but continues with the rest.
6. Finishing Up: After working through all suppliers in the list, the connection to the database is closed.

This process is repeated for each file that contains a list of suppliers, making sure all new supplier data is added systematically and correctly to the database.

ingest_suppliers <- function(df) {
  
  my_connection <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite()

GIFT CARDS

This code is about adding new gift card information to an e-commerce database, ensuring each entry is complete and unique. Here's a simpler explanation:

1. Setting Up: It connects to the database where gift card details need to be stored.
2. Checking the Basics: The code looks for specific pieces of information for each gift card: an ID, a code, some details, and its status. If any expected information is missing, it stops the process.
3. Ensuring Completeness: It checks to make sure the essential details (ID, code, and status) aren't missing for any gift card.
4. Detail Adjustment: The code converts the 'detail' section into a numeric format, perhaps to standardize the data.
5. Adding Gift Cards: It goes through the list, adding each gift card to the database. If a gift card with the same ID already exists, it skips adding it to avoid duplication.
6. Handling Errors: If there's a problem adding a gift card (like incorrect data format or a database issue), it notes the error and moves on.
7. Finishing Up: After all the gift cards in the file have been processed, it closes the connection to the database.

This process is repeated for each file in a set of gift card files, ensuring all new gift card data is correctly added to the database.

PRODUCTS

This code is about adding new product information to an e-commerce database. It's like checking and organizing new stock in a store. Here's a simpler breakdown:

1. Connection Setup: The code first connects to the store's database, ready to update the inventory.
2. Checking the List: It ensures each product comes with specific information: an ID, name, price, quantity in stock, category, and supplier. If any info is missing, the process halts.
3. Preparing the Stock: The quantity of each product is confirmed to be a whole number, possibly to avoid errors with partial products.
4. Ensuring Essentials: It checks that vital information (product ID, stock quantity, category, and supplier) isn't missing from any product.
5. Stocking Shelves: For each product, the code checks if that product is already in the system to avoid duplicates. If it's new, the product's details are added to the database.
6. Troubleshooting: If there's an issue adding a product, like incorrect details or a system error, the code notes the issue but keeps going.
7. Closing Time: Once all products in the list have been processed, the database connection is closed.

This process repeats for each file in a set of product files, ensuring all new products are accurately added to the store's database.

ORDER

This code is about processing new orders in an e-commerce system, Here's a simple explanation:

1. Connection Setup: First, it connects to the store's database to start updating the order records.
2. Checking the Order List: The code makes sure each order includes all the necessary information like order ID, customer ID, product ID, and so on. If something's missing, the process stops.
3. Verifying Order Details: It ensures crucial details like the order ID, the quantity of items, and the order status are present and correct for every order.
4. Processing Orders: For each order, it checks if that order already exists in the database to avoid recording it twice. It also checks if the quantity of items is valid (more than zero and a number).
5. Recording Orders: After passing the checks, each order's details are added to the database.
6. Handling Errors: If there's an issue with adding an order (like incorrect data or a technical glitch), the code notes the problem but continues with the next order.
7. Finishing Up: Once all orders have been processed, it disconnects from the database.

This way, each new order is carefully checked and recorded in the system, ensuring the database is up-to-date and accurate.

SHIPMENTS

This code operates as a data ingestion module for a logistics system, systematically validating and storing each shipment's metadata within the organization's database:

1. Connecting: It links to the database to start processing shipments.
2. Checking: It verifies each shipment has an ID and status before filing.
3. Filing: For each shipment, it checks for duplicates, then files its dispatch and delivery details, along with its status.
4. Handling Issues: If there's a filing error, it's noted, but the process continues.
5. Wrapping Up: After all shipments are filed, it secures the database connection.

This ensures the shipment records are consistently updated and accurate.

These code snippets act as integrity checks for the "ORDERS" table, verifying links to "CUSTOMERS," "PRODUCTS," "GIFT_CARD," and "SHIPMENT" tables:

1. Customer ID Check: Validates that each customer ID in orders corresponds to an entry in the customer table, flagging any discrepancies.
2. Product ID Check: Ensures each product ID in orders matches an item in the product table, highlighting any nonexistent product references.
3. Gift Card ID Check: Confirms gift card IDs in orders exist in the gift card table, identifying any invalid uses.
4. Shipment ID Check: Verifies that each shipment ID in orders is present in the shipment table, detecting any unrecorded or nonexistent shipments.

These checks aim to identify and rectify database inconsistencies, maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of the order system.

customer_id check
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT o.customer_id as customer_id,
              c.customer_id as customer_id,
              first_name ||' '|| last_name as customer_name
           FROM ORDERS as o
           LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS as c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
           WHERE c.customer_id is NULL
           ;")
```

product_id check
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT o.product_id as product_id,
              p.product_id as product_id,
              product_name as product_name
           FROM ORDERS as o
           LEFT JOIN PRODUCTS as p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
           WHERE p.product_id is NULL
           ;")
```

gift_card_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT o.gift_card_id as gif_card_id,
              g.gift_card_id,
              gift_card_code
           FROM ORDERS as o
           LEFT JOIN GIFT_CARD as g ON g.gift_card_id = o.gift_card_id
           WHERE o.gift_card_id is NULL
           ;")
```

shipment_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT o.shipment_id as x,
              s.shipment_id
           FROM ORDERS as o
           LEFT JOIN SHIPMENT as s ON s.shipment_id = o.shipment_id
           WHERE o.shipment_id is NULL
           ORDER BY o.shipment_id
           ;")
```

PRODUCTS


These code snippets validate the "PRODUCTS" table, ensuring products are correctly linked to existing suppliers and categories:

1. Supplier ID Check: Verifies each product's supplier ID against the "SUPPLIERS" table, flagging any mismatches which could indicate incorrect or outdated supplier links.
2. Category ID Check: Confirms each product's category ID with the "PRODUCT_CATEGORY" table, identifying any nonexistent category links, which could suggest mislabeling or missing categories.

These validations are essential for maintaining database integrity and supporting efficient inventory and order management.

supplier_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT p.supplier_id,
              s.supplier_id as a,
              s.supplier_name
           FROM PRODUCTS as p
           LEFT JOIN SUPPLIERS as s ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id
           WHERE s.supplier_id is NULL
           ORDER BY p.supplier_id
           ;")
```

category_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(my_connection,
           "SELECT 
              DISTINCT p.category_id,
              c.category_id as c,
              cat_name
           FROM PRODUCTS as p
           LEFT JOIN PRODUCT_CATEGORY as c ON c.category_id = p.category_id
           WHERE p.category_id is NULL
           ORDER BY p.category_id
           ;")
